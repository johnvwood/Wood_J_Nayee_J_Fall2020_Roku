# Roku Streaming App

This app is a basic mobile-first streaming app that streams and renders dynamic data from several databases and APIs. It includes a login and mediaplayer functionality. The home screen may only be accessed once a user has successfully logged in. On click, the app brings up data of the currently selected TV show or movie, and presents a gateway to view the selected media.
