# Roku Streaming App

This app is a basic mobile-first streaming app that streams and renders dynamic data from several databases or APIs. It includes a login, sign up, share, comment, rate and other popularly used functions of social apps. The home screen may only be accessed once a user has successfully made an account and displays different content depending on whether the user profile is in the kid or adult age range. On click, the app brings up data of the currently selected TV show or movie, and presents a gateway to view the selected media, or simply exit out and choose another.
